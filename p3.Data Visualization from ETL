Step 1: Create charts showing Units in Stock by Product and Total Sales by Year

1. Drag UnitsInStock from the Field pane (the Fields pane is along the right of the
screen) onto a blank space on the canvas. A Table visualization is created. Next, drag
ProductName to the Axis box, found in the bottom half of the Visualizations pane.
Then we then select Sort By > UnitsInStock using the skittles in the top right corer of
the visualization.
2. Drag OrderDate to the canvas beneath the first chart, then drag LineTotal (again, from
the Fields pane) onto the visual, then select Line Chart. The following visualization is
created.
3. Next, drag ShipCountry to a space on the canvas in the top right. Because you selected
a geographic field, a map was created automatically. Now drag LineTotal to the Values
field; the circles on the map for each country are now relative in size to the LineTotal
for orders shipped to that country.
Step 2: Interact with your report visuals to analyze further
Power BI Desktop lets you interact with visuals that cross-highlight and filter each other to
uncover further trends.
1. Click on the light blue circle centered in Canada. Note how the other visuals are
filtered to show Stock (ShipCountry) and Total Orders (LineTotal) just for Canada.
